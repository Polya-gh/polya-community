    title: "Partial fractions",
    difficulty: "medium",
    statement: [
      Decompose into partial fractions: $(5x + 1)/((x+1)(x-2))$.
    ],
    answer: $(4/3)/(x+1) + (11/3)/(x-2)$,
    solution: [
      Write $(5x+1)/((x+1)(x-2)) = A/(x+1) + B/(x-2)$. \
      Then $5x+1 = A(x-2) + B(x+1)$. \
      Setting $x=2$: $11 = 3B => B = 11/3$. \
      Setting $x=-1$: $-4 = -3A => A = 4/3$.

    title: "Growth",
    difficulty: "medium",
    statement: [
      A population starts at 500 and grows at 4% per year. After how many whole years does it first exceed 1000?
    ],
    answer: $18$,
    solution: [
      $500 dot 1.04^t > 1000 => 1.04^t > 2$ \
      $t > (ln 2)/(ln 1.04) approx 17.7$. \
